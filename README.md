# oros

  ## livecoding env
  - add options to turn animations on and off for easy control of overlay/combos 
  - add more animations to the array, consider storing them in a different file
  - start thinking about making it a GAS webapp and linking it to the oros cards....  


- gather all experiments/snippets from phone and computer, put in this repo
- build qr code generator / prettifier / animator
- build gyroscope / other phone sensor utilisation prototypes
- continue the floating card mask/displaying page - either put pics on imgr or make it a webapp to properly serve my drive pics

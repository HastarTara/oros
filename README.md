# oros
- dont use vscode live server however convenient it is - encourage more commits for better github activity/visibility
- gather all experiments/snippets from phone and computer, put in this repo

- build gyroscope / other phone sensor utilisation prototypes


## oros cards
- continue work on the back - get the dynamic iridescence of the qr code, give it a border, poso find perfect card back,etc 
- either put pics on imgr or make it a webapp to properly serve my drive pics
- deeper dive the qr codes / necessary complexity / self reference to the oros it was generated in
- think more about how to structure the codebase seeing as i've now moved from 1 prototype file for the oros template to a standard base of styles, script, etc.
- think about a template mask so the cards can be any shape for interesting more novel file collectible vibes (i.e. a star shape like a mario gold star, look into webgl 3d - focus on ease of display, cross platform, minimal friction, maximum novelty and shareability)
- work on the sigil-unlocker/lockscreen functionality to add a fun ritual to unlocking cards

##  livecoding env
  - add options to turn animations on and off for easy control of overlay/combos - make sure they dont build up and start lagging if thats not wanted
  - add more animations to the array, consider storing them in a different file
  - start thinking about making it a GAS webapp and linking it to the oros cards....  


## misc (will probably need to be moved to its own repo
  - build on the synth experiment (current there is a tone with reverb and lfo)
